                    airline fare rules and cancellation policy, and shall be
                    made by hpw only on the receipt of such refund from the

                    THE TIME OF BOOKING IS A NON-REFUNDABLE FEE. ANY REFUND TO
                    THE USER SHALL BE PROCESSED AFTER DEDUCTING EQUIVALENT
                    AMOUNT TOWARDS THE FEE. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    .Please intimate us at the earliest where any cancellations
                    are made directly with the airline in order to initiate the
                    process of refund to the User. The processing time for
                    refunds may differ depending on the mode of payment, bank
                    etc. In instances where tickets were only partially
                    utilized, refund shall be made after deducting any discount
                    and/or promo code discount availed at the time of booking.
                    <br />
                    The refund will be credited to the hpw money account
                    and/or the same User bank account/ credit card/debit
                    card/wallet etc. from which the payment was originally made
                    by the User unless the User has chosen for instant refund
                    through any other payment mode, after deducting the
                    applicable hpw charges. For instance, if the User used a
                    credit card, the refund will be made to the corresponding
                    credit card. Similarly, if the User had used a debit card
                    for the payment, refund will be made to the same debit card.
                    However, in the event a ticket was booked with a combination
                    of hpw money and debit/credit card, then the refund amount
                    will also be refunded in the same ratio as hpw money and
                    the respective debit/ credit card.In the event of
                    cancellation of a flight ticket, the hpw money earned for
                    that transaction will get deducted from the User’s hpw
                    money account balance. In case the hpw money balance is
                    nil at that moment, the balance will reflect as negative and
                    the same will be adjusted from the hpw money earned from
                    subsequent bookings. <b>No show and Refund :</b>In case of
                    no-show, user shall be required to make request for any
                    valid and applicable refunds, as per the defined policies
                    within 90 days from the travel date in case of airline. No
                    refund would be payable for any requests made after the
                    expiry of 90 days of travel date and all unclaimed amounts
                    for such no-show shall accordingly be deemed to have been
                    forfeited.
